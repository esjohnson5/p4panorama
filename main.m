%% Script to create a panorama image from a sequence of images in `imagepath' directory.

%
% Hint: This script is divided into several code sections delimited by the
% double percentage sign '%%'. Click 'Editor > Run Section' in MATLAB to
% run your current code section.
% 
%%======================================================================
%% 1. Take images
%
% Change the following to the folder containing your input images
clear all;
imagepath = 'test';   
% Assumes images are in order and are the *only*
% files in this directory.
% 
%                         
%%======================================================================
%% 2. Compute feature points, 3. Compute homographies
%
% Modify the calcH function to add code for implementing RANSAC.
% You do not have to modify this code section.
%
% Here we compute feature points and the homography matrices between
% adjacent input images. Homography matrices between adjacent input images
% are then stored in a cell array H_list.

% Read in the list of filenames of images to be processed
files = dir(imagepath);

% Eliminate . and .. and assume everything else in directory is an input
% image. Also assume that all images are color.
imagelist = files(3:end);

for i=1:length(imagelist)-1
    image1 = fullfile(imagepath, imagelist(i).name);
    image2 = fullfile(imagepath, imagelist(i+1).name);
    
    % Find matching feature points between current two images using SIFT
    % features and SIFT algorithm for matching. Note that this code does
    % NOT include the use of RANSAC to find and use only good matches.
    [~, matchIndex, loc1, loc2] = match(image1, image2);
    im1_ftr_pts = loc1(find(matchIndex > 0), 1:2);
    im2_ftr_pts = loc2(matchIndex(find(matchIndex > 0)), 1:2);

    % Calculate 3x3 homography matrix, H, mapping coordinates in image2
    % into coordinates in image1. Function calcH currently uses all pairs
    % of matching feature points returned by the SIFT algorithm.

    % Modify the calcH function to add code for implementing RANSAC.
    H = calcH(im1_ftr_pts, im2_ftr_pts);
    H_list(i) = {H};
end


%%======================================================================
%% 4. Warp images
%
% Select one input image as the reference image, ideally one in the middle
% of the sequence of input images so that there is less distortion in the
% output.
%
% Compute new homographies H_map that map every other image *directly* to
% the reference image by composing H matrices in H_list. Save these new
% homographies in a list called H_map. Hence H_map is a list of 3 x 3
% homography matrices that map each image into the reference image's
% coordinate system.
% 
% The homography in H_map that is associated with the reference image
% should be the identity matrix, created using eye(3) The homographies in
% H_map for the other images (both before and after the reference image)
% are computed by using already defined matrices in H_map and H_list as
% described in the homework.
%
% Note: Composing A with B is not the same as composing B with A.
% Note: H_map and H_list are cell arrays, which are general containers in
% Matlab. For more info on using cell arrays, see:
% http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-cell-array.html

%% 5. Blend images
%
% Now that we've warped each input image separately and assigned them to
% warped_images (a cell array with as many elements as the number of input
% images), blend the input images into a single panorama.


% Initialize output image to black (0)

%
% Modify the code below to blend warped images together via feathering The
% following code adds warped images directly to panorama image. This is a
% very bad blending method - implement feathering instead.

for i= 1 : length(warped_images)
    img = cell2mat(warped_images(i));
    im_binary = rgb2gray(img) == 0;
    alpha(:,:,1) = bwdist(im_binary);
    alpha(:,:,2) = bwdist(im_binary);
    alpha(:,:,3) = bwdist(im_binary);
    numerator = alpha.*img + numerator;

%for i = 1 : length(warped_images)
%   panorama_image = panorama_image + warped_images{i};
%end

% Save your final output image as a .jpg file and name it according to
% the directions in the assignment.
